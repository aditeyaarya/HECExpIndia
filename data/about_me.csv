Mridul Malani,"I like to think of myself as an opportunist, in the best sense of the word. From growing up in a naval family to studying economics in India and now finance in France, adaptability has been my constant. I’ve worked with startups, VCs and equity funds — learning how capital, strategy and people come together. I’m fascinated by how capital flows shape businesses and how the right investment at the right time can transform entire industries. That curiosity has taken me from building equity research models at a $30M long-only equity fund to sourcing early-stage deals for VCs to analysing MSME startups at IndiaMart. Now at HEC Paris (MIM, International Finance), I’m continuing to explore the spectrum of investing — private equity, public markets and everything in between. I thrive in dynamic environments, love connecting dots across industries, and enjoy treating challenges the same way I treat an investment decision: analyze, optimize, execute. Interested in the world of sustainability, and always trying to come up with something new that I could potentially build. 
 

 Quirk: If you ever want to discuss how F1 pit stop strategies are just financial modeling at 300 km/h, I’m your guy.
