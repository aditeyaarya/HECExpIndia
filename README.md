# 🌏 HEC ExperienceIndia

**A cultural bridge for Indian and international students at HEC Paris.**

HEC ExperienceIndia is a student-led initiative to help HEC Paris students and the wider international community explore Indian culture through movies, food, sports, and more. This repository hosts the source code and assets for the public-facing website — a **lightweight, content-first digital hub** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (static MVP), with future scalability to Bubble.io or similar dynamic platforms.

## 📋 Overview

**Status:**  
MVP completed — static HTML site hosted on Netlify. Future roadmap includes Google sign-in, reviews, and content management system integration.
